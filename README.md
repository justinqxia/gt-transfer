# gt-transfer
The idea behind this project is to help Georgia Tech students find other universities that GT will accept credit from. 
Students can search a GT course number and the website will return a list of universities that offer courses that can be transferred to GT. 
Additionally, students can filter the results by state to find local universities they can dual enroll at.
This information is already availible through Georgia Tech, but accessing it requires you to first search by state, then by university, and then by department.
Our vision was to allow students to search by course, which would then direct students to prospective universities.
The data is collect using a web scrapper written in Python. Then the data is uploaded to a database, which is accessed by the website.
